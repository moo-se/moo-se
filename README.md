👋 Hi, I’m Moose- a backend engineer
👀 I’m interested in code, chess, great books, coffee, and deep philosophical conversations 🌍
🌱 I’m currently reading scopes & closures from the you don't know javascript series by Kyle Simpson
🥸 Favorite authors: Robert Greene & Ryan Holiday
✨ I'm in search of mentally stimulating work experiences that push me to think differently and broaden my mental horizon
