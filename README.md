👀 I’m interested in code, chess, great books, coffee, and deep conversations 🌍
🌱 I’m currently reading scopes & closures from the you don't know javascript series by Kyle Simpson
🥸 Favorite authors: Robert Greene & Ryan Holiday
📚 Top 3 books: Mastery, The Laws Of Human Nature by Robert Greene & Discipline Is Destiny by Ryan Holiday
